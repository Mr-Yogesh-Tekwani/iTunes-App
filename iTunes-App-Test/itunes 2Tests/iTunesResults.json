      "description": "Bodies of young men are turning up, dressed unusually in gowns and posed like dolls. When a tarot reader offers FBI Special Agent Taylor Sage a clue to finding the diabolical serial killer, Taylor has no choice but to open her mind and follow the trail. What she encounters, though, is far more harrowing than anything she expected—and may just change everything she thought she knew.<br /><br />DON’T LOOK is the debut novel in a new series by critically acclaimed and #1 bestselling mystery and suspense author Molly Black.<br /><br />FBI Special Agent Taylor Sage has crossed the country and transferred to her dream job with the BAU at Quantico. With a new job, a new house, and her husband by her side, Taylor is ready to put the darkness of her past behind her: a sister who vanished when she was a teenager.<br /><br />Taylor is ready for a fresh start. But when a tarot reader on the boardwalk offers an uncannily specific prediction about her next case, Taylor, ready to brush it off, is haunted by it—and can’t help noticing that it was accurate.<br /><br />The BAU is stumped by this new serial killer, by the posed bodies, and it seems only Taylor can decode the riddle. But time is running out, and Taylor will have to use every tool at her disposal to save the next victim, whether she believes in it or not. <br /><br />Might the tarot reader hold the key?<br /><br />Or is she leading Taylor down a fatal dead end?<br /><br />A complex psychological crime thriller full of twists and turns and packed with heart-pounding suspense, the TAYLOR SAGE mystery series will make you fall in love with a brilliant new female protagonist and keep you turning pages late into the night.<br /><br />Books #2 and #3 in the series—DON’T BREATHE and DON’T RUN—are now also available."

With time running out, expert deep sea rescue diver Jonas Taylor (Jason Statham) is recruited by a visionary Chinese oceanographer (Winston Chao) to save the crew—and the ocean itself—from this unstoppable threat: a pre-historic 75-foot-long shark known as the Megalodon. What no one could have imagined is that years before, Taylor had encountered this same terrifying creature. Now he must risk his own life to save everyone trapped below...bringing him face to face once more with the greatest and largest predator of all time!",

But Mowgli finds he’s no longer welcome in the jungle when fearsome tiger Shere Khan (voice of Idris Elba), who bears the scars of Man, promises to eliminate what he sees as a threat. Urged to abandon the only home he’s ever known, Mowgli embarks on a captivating journey of self-discovery, guided by panther-turned-stern-mentor Bagheera (voice of Ben Kingsley) and the free-spirited bear Baloo (voice of Bill Murray). Along the way, Mowgli encounters jungle creatures who don’t exactly have his best interests at heart, including Kaa (voice of Scarlett Johansson), a python whose seductive voice and gaze hypnotizes the man-cub, and the smooth-talking King Louie (voice of Christopher Walken), who tries to coerce Mowgli into giving up the secret to the elusive and deadly red flower: fire.",

Discovering her name is Beth (Schilling) and where she lives, he shows up at her door, and ends up taking a job at her family-run local kennel. Despite her initial mistrust and the complications in her life, a romance develops between them, giving Logan hope that Beth could be much more than his good luck charm."
